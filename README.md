## Update 11/15/2023

To run all you need is 2 folder:
    - an input folder with all the MRA images,
    - an output folder where you wish you have all the skull stripped MRAs

You should then edit the paths in main.sh to read the correct input and output folder

Then execute run main.sh

# Installation

Simply install requirements.txt and it should be good to go
